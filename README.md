# Basket - E-Commerce Website

## Overview
Basket is a fully functional e-commerce website built with JavaScript, leveraging the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It allows users to log in, choose their location using an interactive map, edit user data, add products to their cart, calculate the total cost, and proceed with payments using Stripe's test mode. The project integrates external APIs like Fake Store API for user authentication and Stripe for payment processing.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Log in using Fake Store API credentials.
- **Location Selection:** Interactive Mapbox-based map for selecting and saving the user's location.
- **Cart System:** Add and remove items, view total cost, and update cart dynamically.
- **User Profile Management:** Edit and save user details after login.
- **Payment Integration:** Test Stripe payments using test card details.
- **MVC Architecture:** Code structured with separate concerns for Model, View, and Controller.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across different devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Map Integration:** Mapbox GL JS
- **API Integration:** Fake Store API for authentication and product data
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe (Test Mode)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Hosting:** Netlify
